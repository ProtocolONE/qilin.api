# Qilin - DRM Platform

Qilin is an open source tool facilitating creation, distribution and activation of licenses for game content. 

The mission of Qilin n is to enable developers, publishers, platforms and stores to distribute games,
reducing their efforts on concluding and drafting contracts and exchanging documentation to a
minimum, and providing them with comprehensive statistics in real time.

Our solution is a part of Protocol One IAAS, it is actively used in Storefront constructor. Qilin
can be installed as a component on an existing P1-independent system, employing its own
hardware or cloud platform.

listing of games within the Protocol One ecosystem.
